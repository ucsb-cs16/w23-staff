# Effective Strategies for Online Learning

This document was adapted from material originally posted during the Covid-19 Pandemic by the [UCSB Office of Instructional Development](https://id.ucsb.edu).  [The original source

Taking an online class when you are used to in-person classes means a transition in learning environments, approaches, and strategies. 
We’ve compiled some tips and resources to help you become a successful online learner. 
Please remember to be patient with yourself, your classmates, and your instructors.

# Getting Started

Before you begin, consider the following:

* **Learning space**: Do you have the environment you need to focus and work? Consider establishing a designated work space and making it as comfortable as possible. Limited on space and quiet? Use headphones and quiet background music that might help you focus. YouTube is a good option for free study music – the ONDAS Student Center and Transfer Student Center peers love [LoFi hip hop radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A).
* **Learning tools**: All UCSB students have access to the G Suite: Gmail, Calendar, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Hangouts, and more. Familiarize yourself with these useful learning and social tools, and remember to check your email every day. GauchoSpace or Canvas will house material for most, if not all, of your courses. Zoom can be used for classes, office hours, and group meetings. This site also offers tips for GauchoSpace and Zoom.
* **Computer**: You will need access to a computer, ideally with camera capabilities. If you find yourself without access to a computer, this link may have some helpful resources for loaner computers available to UCSB Students: <https://food.ucsb.edu/resources/technology-resources>
* **Reliable Internet**: Make sure you will have access to reliable internet.
* **Syllabi**: Read your syllabus for each class carefully! Each class will have its own requirements. 
  Be sure to check whether your class is meeting live on Zoom/other technology (synchronous) or if you are expected to 
  complete the course material at your own pace (asynchronous). 
  Make sure to pay close attention to your deadlines. For help understanding your syllabi, visit [CLAS](https://clas.sa.ucsb.edu/) and view the workshop titled [Learning Online: Three Exercises](https://prezi.com/view/3Qz8hPAb5lRYIx23vUgI/).

Exploring New Study Habits
</summary>
 
Learning online will likely mean you need to practice study habits that differ to ones practiced during face-to-face instruction. Below are some suggested strategies and tools to try out for online learning:

* Exercises for online learning from CLAS: logon to [myCLAS](https://myclas.sa.ucsb.edu/login.aspx) and search for the Academic Skills workshop titled Learning Online: Three Exercises.
* Reading effectively using the [SQ3R method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ona44EaMSv4)
* Distributed practice: Break up your studying into short sessions distributed across time - the opposite of cramming at the last minute.
* Practice testing: Getting something wrong can help you retain the right answer. The best practice tests are the ones that force you to do free recall, not just recognize the right answer. More practice tests are better than fewer.
* Self-explanation: Having to explain to yourself why something is correct or how information fits together significantly aids learning. The practice of relating it to other information makes this different from just summarizing.
